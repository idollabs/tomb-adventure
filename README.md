# tomb-adventure
An experiment in media queries

Taking influence from old flash games, this pure vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project serves as both a game and a test of my understanding of media queries.

This project presents a very unrealistic, but experimental use of media queries in CSS3.

The project must be opened ona. computer, where the window size and be expanded and contracted. Adjust the window so it is not full screen, but the text 'Enter the Tomb' appears.

Expand and contract the window unstil you have discovered every tablet!
